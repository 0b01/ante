//! cache/mod.rs - Provides the ModuleCache struct which the ante compiler
//! pervasively uses to cache and store results from various compiler phases.
//! The most important things the cache stores are additional information about
//! the parse tree. For example, for each variable definition, there is a corresponding
//! `DefinitionInfo` struct and a `DefinitionInfoId` key that can be used on the
//! cache to access this struct. The `DefinitionInfo` struct stores additional information
//! about a definition like the `ast::Definition` node it was defined in, its name,
//! whether it is mutable, and how many times it is referenced in the program.
//! This XXXInfo and XXXInfoId pattern is also used for TraitDefinitions, TraitImpls, and Types.
//! See the corresponding structs further down in this file for more information.
//!
//! The ModuleCache itself is kept the entirely of compilation - its contents may be
//! used in any phase and thus nothing is freed until the program is fully linked.
//! Any pass-specific information that isn't needed for later phases shouldn't be
//! kept in the ModuleCache and instead should be in a special data structure for
//! the relevant phase. An example is the `llvm::Generator` in the llvm codegen phase.

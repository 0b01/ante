        lexerr.an
    shows possible types of errors caught during the lexing
    phase.  Since lexing errors are almost always fatal, compilation
    is usually halted after the first incidence.
`

~Extraneous numbers after type suffix
let i = 5_i321

~Scope underflow caused by unindent literal
let ans = 5;;

~And worst of all, use of the tab character in significant whitespace
if ans == i
	puts("ans == i")

    Test detection and formatting of various compile-time errors.
    Currently, this file contains three undeclared variables, a, aa, and c,
    as well as a redefinition of a, and the attempted mutation of an immutable
    variable.
`


~type mismatch
let i32 b = 4.3

var a = 3
~a redeclared
var a = 5

~aa never declared
aa = 4

let five = 6

~mutated immutable variable
five = 5

~Invalid type cast
let typecasterr = i32 "test"


~Wrong return type:
fun someFunc: -> i32,i32
    ()

~Function not declared
let res = someFnc()
someFunc()

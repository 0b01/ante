       multiVarDecl.an
   Test ability to declare multiple variables
   in a single statement as well as destructure
   tuples to assign each index to a seperate
   variable.
`
~Declare 2 i32s
let (a,b) = (3,4)

let c = sqrt(f64 a*a + b*b)

~Declare and set x, y, and z to 0
var x y z = 0

~y and z are constituent types of the tuple
~1, 2 so the tuple is destructured and y and z
~are set to each index.
(y, z) = (1, 2)

print(a, b, c, x, y, z)
~output:  3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2

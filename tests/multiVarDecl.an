       multiVarDecl.an
   Test ability to declare multiple variables
   in a single statement as well as destructure
   tuples to assign each index to a seperate
   variable.
`

void main:
    ~Declare 3 floats
    f64 a b c

    a = 3
    b = 4

    c = sqrt(a*a + b*b)

    ~Declare and set x, y, and z to 0
    u32 x y z = 0
    
    ~y and z are constituent types of the tuple
    ~1, 2 so the tuple is destructured and y and z
    ~are set to each index.
    y z = 1, 2

    print(a, b, c, x, y, z)
~output:  3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2
